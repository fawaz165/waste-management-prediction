## Architecture

**IoT Devices (Smart Bins)**

- These are the sensors deployed at various locations to collect data on waste levels, types, and timestamps. 
- They send this data to a central system for further processing.

**Data Collection**

- This stage involves gathering the data from the IoT devices.
- It may also include simulating IoT data for testing and development purposes.

**Data Preprocessing**

- This step prepares the collected data for analysis and modeling. 
- It typically includes:
    - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the data to understand its characteristics, identify patterns, and handle missing values.
    - **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
    - **Normalization and Scaling:** Transforming the data to a common scale to ensure fair comparison and efficient model training.

**Model Training & Optimization**

- This is where machine learning models are built and tuned.
- The architecture uses two main models:
    - **SARIMA (Prediction Model):** A time-series forecasting model to predict future waste levels.
    - **XGBoost (Classification Model):** A tree-based ensemble model to classify waste types.
- **Optuna (Hyperparameter Tuning):** A library used to optimize the hyperparameters of both models to achieve better performance.
- **Meta-Regressor (Ensemble Model):** Combines the predictions of the SARIMA and XGBoost models to create a more robust and accurate overall prediction.

**Real-Time Monitoring and Alerting**

- This component uses a dashboard (e.g., Grafana, Power BI) to visualize the real-time data and predictions.
- It also generates alerts for waste collection when bins are full or nearing capacity.
- The alerts are sent to the waste management team to trigger timely collection operations.

**Overall, the architecture aims to:**

- **Optimize waste collection routes:** By predicting waste levels and types, the system can plan more efficient collection routes, reducing costs and environmental impact.
- **Improve service efficiency:** Real-time monitoring and alerts ensure timely collection, preventing overflowing bins and potential public health issues.
- **Reduce waste generation:** By analyzing waste data, the system can identify trends and patterns, which can inform waste reduction strategies.

This architecture demonstrates a practical application of IoT and machine learning in addressing real-world challenges like waste management. By leveraging data-driven insights and automation, it can contribute to more sustainable and efficient urban environments.
