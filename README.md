## Parameters Used
### **1. SARIMA Parameters**
- **Order (p, d, q)**:
  - `p`: Number of autoregressive terms.
  - `d`: Degree of differencing to remove trends.
  - `q`: Number of moving average terms.
- **Seasonal Order (P, D, Q, s)**:
  - `P`: Seasonal autoregressive terms.
  - `D`: Seasonal differencing for seasonal trends.
  - `Q`: Seasonal moving average terms.
  - `s`: Seasonal cycle length (e.g., 12 for monthly data).

### **2. XGBoost Parameters**
- **Learning Rate (`eta`)**: Controls how much each tree contributes to the final model.
- **Max Depth**: Maximum depth of trees to prevent overfitting (e.g., 3–10).
- **n_estimators**: Number of trees in the ensemble.
- **Min Child Weight**: Minimum sum of instance weights in a child node.
- **Subsample**: Fraction of samples used per tree to prevent overfitting (e.g., 0.8).
- **Colsample_bytree**: Fraction of features used per tree.
- **Gamma**: Minimum loss reduction required to split a node.
- **Reg_alpha and Reg_lambda**: L1 and L2 regularization terms to reduce model complexity.

### **3. Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna**
- **Search Space**:
  - SARIMA: Seasonal parameters (P, D, Q, s).
  - XGBoost:
    - `max_depth`: Integer (e.g., 3–10).
    - `learning_rate`: Continuous (e.g., 0.01–0.1).
    - `n_estimators`: Integer (e.g., 50–300).
- **Objective Function**:
  - Minimize error metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
  - Maximize accuracy or R² scores.

### **4. Data Preprocessing Parameters**
- **Normalization**:
  - Scale features using Min-Max scaling to ensure all data points fall within [0, 1].
- **Lag Variables**:
  - Create new features by looking back at previous time steps (e.g., daily or weekly trends).
- **Window Size**:
  - Specify how far back to analyze data for temporal patterns.


### **5. Evaluation Metrics**
- **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Assess the classification accuracy for bin statuses.
- **MAE and RMSE**: Measure forecasting errors for waste generation.
- **R² Score**: Evaluate the goodness-of-fit for regression models.

### **6. Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts**
- **Threshold Values**:
  - Alerts are triggered when bin fullness exceeds a certain percentage (e.g., 80%).
- **Update Interval**:
  - Define how often predictions are updated in real-time (e.g., hourly or daily).

### **7. Combined Model Parameters (Meta Regressor)**
- **Weighting Factors**:
  - Assign weights to SARIMA and XGBoost outputs (e.g., SARIMA: 40%, XGBoost: 60%).
- **Normalization**:
  - Scale predictions from both models to ensure compatibility.
